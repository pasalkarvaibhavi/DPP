Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SQL Query:

SELECT country.continent, FLOOR(AVG(city.population))
FROM country
INNER JOIN city 
ON country.code = city.countrycode
GROUP BY country.continent
