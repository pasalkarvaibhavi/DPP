Calculate Salaries

Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.
Return the result table in any order. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

SQL Query:

select t1.company_id,t1.employee_id,t1.employee_name, cast(t1.salary - t2.test*t1.salary/100 as int) as salary
from salaries t1 
join (select company_id , max(salary), 
        case when max(salary)<1000 then 0 
        when max(salary) between 1000 and 10000 then 24
        when max(salary) > 10000 then 49
        end as test
from salaries 
group by 1) t2
on t1.company_id=t2.company_id;
